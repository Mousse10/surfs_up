## Overview of the Analysis 

An investor wants to learn more about the weather before committing to build a Surf and Ice Cream Shop in Oahu, Hawaii. The investor's main concern is the precipitation forcing the shop to close too frequently. To analyze Hawaii's weather data, SQLAlchemy was used to query the SQLite database. More specifically, the investor would like temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

Upon further review, we were able to us the following code in order to get the temperature results for both June and December respectively:

- From the database that we pulled, we are able to see that the temperatures in June and December have similar temperatures. 
- The lowest temperature is in December while the hightest temperature is in June. 
- Our temperarture summary statistics show that June typically has a higher mean temperature at 74.9 compared to December at 71.0.
- Where 50% of the temperatures recorded for June were above 75.0, median temperature for December was 71.0.
- June has a minimum temperature of 64.0 while December has a minimum temperature of 56.0.

## Summary

Following our analysis of the temperatures in June and December, we can confirm that the two seasons have relatively similar temperatures which are favoralble for the potential Surf and Ice Cream Shop investment. This is a good sign but we would need to do an additional analysis on the precipitation during the two seasons to strengthen our previous conclusion. This would be great to further confirm that this would be a good investment and that weather should not be an issue for this buisness. In order to perform this analysis, we would need to run the following queries.
